The hope is to make a pgm library in Rust. Transformation of variables between nodes should be
equations. Focusing first on representations. How will data be represented in this library?
The goal is to construct a “model of a system about which we would like to reason”.
More generally, just looking at declarative representations of a model so that the reasoning process is
independent of the representation.

# TODO 

- [] What are the types of interest (using Koller and Friedman)?
- [] Investigate a graphing library.
